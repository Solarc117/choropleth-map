How will I approach this next task?
  - I'll try giving myself deadlines this time, like Cal Newport suggested.
  - I will STOP this project, no matter its state, once December 6th rolls around.

*************************** DECEMBER 5TH, 23:59 DEADLINE **************************************************

Now that the deadline is set, I need to break it down into smaller deadlines, estimating (REMEMBER: make your estimates AT LEAST 1.5x as long as you normally would, perhaps even twice as slow; life gets in the way and that's ok) how long each smaller task will take.

Okay, now to break up the project into smaller, manageable tasks.

1. Setting up the repository
2. Initializing files and getting them to work
3. Downloading both data required for the project and logging them to the console to ensure they work
4. Getting a rough idea for how rendering the different states of the US will work

  Past this task, I might wanna re-evaluate my approach, since I don't know how long it'll take me to render this data or how even to approach it. So I'll just write down the tasks that I KNOW I need to do, and add any extra tasks that pop up afterward, as well as sort out in which order I'll tackle them.

5+. Render the states on the canvas.
5+. Color each state dynamically.
5+. Render the legend for the different states.
5+. Display the currently hovered state's information with a tooltip.
5+. BONUS: think of and implement a different way to display the information besides a tooltip positioned near the user's cursor.
5+. Add a title, source, and my github link.
5+. BONUS: allow the user to choose from different color schemes (more accessible for colorblind individuals)

Since I don't know the full extent of this project yet, since I haven't worked with geographical data before, I can't schedule the whole project yet. I'll just have to tackle the first few tasks I KNOW I have to do as quickly as possible.

CURRENT TASK/DEADLINE: First four tasks, tomorrow MAX
- I can be more specific, dividing time up between these four tasks.
CURRENT TASK: finish setting up the repo
DEADLINE: 16:00 TODAY
